#Project The next Life

A collection of ideas and suggestions how we could organize everything if there would be endless money and if everybody would concentrate in working together in achieving commong goals.

## Assumption
Think of a world like it was hundreds of years ago - Egypts, Chinese, Mayas, Incas, Babylonia, ... and so on. Most of them concentrated their energy on activities they classified to be important (and they tried to live *with* and *together* with the nature, as there where no other possibilites). And now think of a modern world, where *all* of us -living on the same planet- try *really* to bring *us* forward as a whole - and not only individual groups.

Now, the assumption for this collection is:
- All "Governments" work together and jointly work on projects which improve live for everyone and the environment
- Every individual follows the agreed rules

That would lead to the main assumption:
- All projects can be financed, as not only money will not being wasted on wars any more, but banks and "investors" will finance projects backed by "governments" and the new civil rules....

**Let's think of a "green field" project for everything in our live, with endless budget. 
What would you do?**

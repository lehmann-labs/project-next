#Cities and Regions
Status of this document: draft

## Introduction

### Definition
A city or a region is defined by:
- a high amount of people living in a relatively concentrated geological region
- everything which is needed for a living is available (except possibly food):
	- health (doctors, pharamacies, hospitals, ...)
	- education (schools, universities, ...)
	- organizational (public offices, ...)
	- ...

## Infrastructure


### Architecture

Random collection, should be applicable to every type of house - regardless of it's usage and size:
- Roofs/housetops of houses have to be used:
	- (as garden) for leisure activities (then roofs should be interconnected with walkways) - this usage should be the standard usage
	- energy/power production (e.g. solar)
	- for greenhouses (e.g. aquaponics), growing plants for usage
	- rain water collection (no "wasting", should always be used somehow)
- Basement is used always for storage *AND* garages and/or parking lots for the underground streets. Every flat should have a parking lot.



#### Houses for living
There are 3 types of houses (at the moment):
- Blocks (>6 flats)
- Medium houses (2-6 flats)
- Small houses (1-2 flats)

Regardless of the type of the house, there should always be a consolidated and efficient way to consume power, water, etc. in a neighborhood
- e.g. shared solar cells on the roofs and power saving methods on the the complete neighborhood
- e.g. common facilities for garbage and waste collection and recycling locally/onsite
- local shops for daily living (supermarket, butcher, clothes, etc...)
- parks


##### Blocks

#### Houses for offices


### Transportation
Following transportation facilities are moved to the underground:
- Streets for cars, busses and trucks
- Trains

Above ground there are still (small) streets for exceptional transport:
- Police, Fire Brigade, Ambulance
- sidewalk/foot paths and bikes or similar (small electrical vehicals, segway, etc.)
- optional: Tram
- Trucks and Tools for building & maintaining infrastructure

#Cities and Regions
Status of this document: draft

## Introduction

### Definition
A city or a region is defined by:
- a high amount of people living in a relatively concentrated geological region
- everything which is needed for a living is available (except possibly food):
	- health (doctors, pharamacies, hospitals, ...)
	- education (schools, universities, ...)
	- organizational (public offices, ...)
	- ...

## Infrastructure


### Architecture

Random collection of ideas, should be applicable to every type of house - regardless of it's usage and size:
- Roofs/housetops of houses have to be used:
	- (as garden) for leisure activities (then roofs should be interconnected with walkways) - this usage should be the standard usage
	- energy/power/heat production (e.g. solar)
	- for greenhouses (e.g. aquaponics), growing plants for usage
	- rain water collection (no "wasting", should always be used somehow)
- Basement is used always for storage *AND* garages and/or parking lots for the underground streets. Every flat should have a parking lot.

The space between the houses are used as:
- Walk and pathways (for tram, bikes, and other small personal transport)
- Maintenance streets (only used exceptional)
- Parks with trees (better climate in summer)
- Playgrounds for kids
- Meeting areas (e.g. space for local, weekly markets)
- Restaurants, Cafes, Bars
- Sport grounds


#### Houses for living
There are 3 types of houses (at the moment):
- Blocks (>6 flats)
- Medium houses (2-6 flats)
- Small houses (1-2 flats)

Regardless of the type of the house, there should always be a consolidated and efficient way to consume power, water, etc. in a neighborhood
- e.g. shared solar cells on the roofs and power saving methods on the the complete neighborhood
- e.g. common facilities for garbage and waste collection and recycling locally/onsite
- local shops for daily living (supermarket, butcher, clothes, etc...)
- parks


##### Blocks

**Ground Level**
The ground level of the blocks should protect the pedestrians becoming wet during rain or to much sun. This level will be used for local shops, kindergarten, local organizations offices, etc.

**Inner Courtyard**
Mixed usage for leisure, or playground for kids. Possibly growing plants (e.g. Bambus) to be used by the block community, a pond (grow fish, store water,...), etc.

**Last Floor**
The last floor should be used as a connection to the roof. Here small swimmingpools, libraries cinemas, etc. can be placed.

#### Houses for offices
Similar rules as for "Blocks" apply.

### Energy
#### Solar Energy
Solar collectors are placed on the south side/facade of the houses. They can be placed not only ony roofs, but as well in window shutters, balustrades/railings, facades.

Each house/block/neighborhood should be self contained from an energy point of view.

#### Energy harvesting for houses
Random list of incomplete ideas:
- Recover heat from the wastewater
- Central exhaust air heat exchanger (with central air condition)

#### Energy Storing
As mentioned before, to increase efficiency probably at least neighborhood wide used storages should be put in place, backed by smaller housewide facilities.

Random list of incomplete ideas:
- Electricity: Batteries
- Heat: IceBank, Insulated Water Tanks, Molten Salt and other (heat storage in hot rocks, concrete, pebbles)

### Transportation
Following transportation facilities are moved to the underground:
- Streets for cars, busses and trucks
- Trains

Above ground there are still (small) streets for exceptional transport:
- Police, Fire Brigade, Ambulance
- sidewalk/foot paths and bikes or similar (small electrical vehicals, segway, etc.)
- optional: Tram
- Trucks and Tools for building & maintaining infrastructure
